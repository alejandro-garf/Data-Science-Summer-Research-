# AI/ML Jobs Analysis Project{https://github.com/alejandro-garf/Data-Science-Summer-Research-/blob/main/AIandMLResearchNotebook.ipynb}

This project analyzes AI/ML job listings data from LinkedIn. The analysis includes visualizing job types, experience levels, and predicting trends over time.

## Project Overview

The main tasks performed in this project are:

1. **Data Loading and Display**:
   - Loaded AI/ML job listings data from a CSV file.
   - Displayed data in a scrollable table, excluding the 'description' column.

2. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Displayed summary statistics for categorical features.
   - Analyzed null values and the percentage of missing values for each feature.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted the distribution of contract vs full-time jobs.
   - Displayed and plotted the experience level breakdown for both contract and full-time positions.
   - Compared experience level breakdowns for contract vs full-time positions.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Prepared data for time series analysis.
   - Trained a linear regression model to predict the number of contract jobs over time.
   - Plotted actual and predicted contract job trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Plotly** for creating interactive plots.
- **SciPy** for statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning and prediction.
- **Matplotlib** for additional plotting capabilities.
